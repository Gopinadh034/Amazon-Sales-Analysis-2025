# Amazon-Sales-Analysis-2025
Performed EDA on Amazon Sales 2025 dataset using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn). Analyzed sales trends, customer behavior, and payment methods. Generated visual insights including monthly sales, top categories, and cumulative revenue trends.
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Amazon Sales 2025 dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. It focuses on cleaning the dataset, extracting useful features like month and category, and visualizing important sales trends including monthly performance, customer location behavior, payment method usage, and cumulative revenue growth. The project is useful for beginners learning data analysis, students building portfolio projects, businesses trying to understand sales patterns, and analysts practicing data visualization. Users can get started by cloning the repository, installing the required libraries, and opening the Jupyter Notebook file (Amazon.ipynb) to run the analysis step-by-step. Help is available through the GitHub Issues section, documentation of the respective Python libraries, or by contacting the project maintainer directly. The project is maintained by Gopinadh Potta, and contributions are welcome from anyone who wants to improve or expand the analysis.
